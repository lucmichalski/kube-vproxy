# HTTP up front, Protobufs in the rear.

An demonstration of Golang micro-services that accept HTTP/JSON requests at API level and then
leverage [gRPC][1] for inter-service communication.

![new_sequence](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/739782/7439604/d1f324c2-f036-11e4-958a-6f6913049946.png)

The API Endpoint accepts HTTP requests on port `5000` and then spawns a number of RPC requests to the backend services.

_Note:_ Data for each of the services is stored in JSON flat files under the `/data/` directory. In reality each of the services could choose their own specialty datastore. The Geo service for example could use PostGis or any other database specializing in geospacial queries.

### Installation

Protobuf v3 are required:

    $ brew install protobuf --devel

Install the protoc-gen libraries:

    $ go get -u github.com/golang/protobuf/{proto,protoc-gen-go}

Clone the repository:

    $ git clone git@github.com:harlow/go-micro-services.git

If changes are made to the Protocol Buffers a Make file can be used to regenerate:

    $ make -s

### Bootstrap the services

To make the demo as straigforward as possible; [foreman][2] is used to run all the services. In a production environment each of the services would be run (and scaled) independently.

    foreman start

Curl the endpoint with an invalid auth token:

    $ curl http://localhost:5000 -H "Authorization: Bearer INVALID_TOKEN"
    Unauthorized

Curl the endpoint without checkin or checkout dates:

    $ curl "http://localhost:5000?inDate=2015-04-09" -H "Authorization: Bearer VALID_TOKEN"
    Please specify outDate

Curl the API endpoint with a valid auth token:

    $ curl "http://localhost:5000?inDate=2015-04-09&outDate=2015-04-10" -H "Authorization: Bearer VALID_TOKEN"

The JSON response:

```json
{
    "hotels": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "Clift Hotel",
            "phoneNumber": "(415) 775-4700",
            "description": "A 6-minute walk from Union Square and 4 minutes from a Muni Metro station, this luxury hotel designed by Philippe Starck features an artsy furniture collection in the lobby, including work by Salvador Dali.",
            "address": {
                "streetNumber": "495",
                "streetName": "Geary St",
                "city": "San Francisco",
                "state": "CA",
                "country": "United States",
                "postalCode": "94102"
            }
        }
    ],
    "ratePlans": [
        {
            "hotelId": 1,
            "code": "RACK",
            "inDate": "2015-04-09",
            "outDate": "2015-04-10",
            "roomType": {
                "bookableRate": 109,
                "totalRate": 109,
                "TotalRateInclusive": 123.17,
                "code": "KNG"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### Tracing the requests

To help visualize the request/response patterns between services there is an additional trace server that will boot w/ the services.

The web service generates the first trace ID. It prints to the logs:

```
18:43:05 web.1     | 2015/09/13 18:43:05 traceId=baec5498-2f4f-439c-629b-18b57d974888
```

When can then take the trace ID and view the sequence diagram here:

http://localhost:5001/?traceId=[TRACE_ID]
