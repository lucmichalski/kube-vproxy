# Kube- Vision

## Tradeoffs solved



### Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open source system for managing [containerized applications](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/wiki/Why-Kubernetes%3F#why-containers) across multiple hosts,
providing basic mechanisms for deployment, maintenance, and scaling of applications.

Kubernetes is:

* **lean**: lightweight, simple, accessible
* **portable**: public, private, hybrid, multi cloud
* **extensible**: modular, pluggable, hookable, composable
* **self-healing**: auto-placement, auto-restart, auto-replication

Kubernetes builds upon a [decade and a half of experience at Google running production workloads at scale](https://research.google.com/pubs/pub43438.html), combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.
